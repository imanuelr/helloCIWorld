ConcourseCI
+ Full setup available in Docker -> tryout mode in prebuilt Vagrant
+ Configurable via yaml files, very readable
+ Clean, concise UI
+ Reusable tasks, jobs, resources.. easy to define them in seperate yaml files
- Requires some tutorials to understand all the concepts (tasks, resources, workers, controllers,...)

Conclusion: Will try to build a more complex actual pipeline with this.

What is the tool for exactly (CI? CD? both? ...?) => Both
How hard was the setup? => really easy, containerized system (in Docker I had issues with key pairs in windows)
How clean is the interface? => Neat, concise, easy overview. Even for very big pipelines
How flexible is the tool? => Haven't gone deep enough into the tool to answer this
How does it visualise build pipelines (if present)? => pipelines are connected based on the way tasks and jobs are connected in the yaml files. Pipelines are native to Concourse
How much of the configuration can be versioned as code? => everything! All pipelines, tasks, controllers, jobs, etc.. are built via yaml files. When you update these files you can use the fly CLI command set to reconfigure existing pipelines

LambdaCD
+ configurable as code
+ Uses a format that is compatible with CCMenu, BuildNotify, Nevergreen, ..
- Doesnt look as pretty
- Closure as config -> also requires leiningen as CLI tool

--> technical difficulties in setting up leiningen on windows. Dropping lambdaCD after timebox passed.
Conclusion: Might check it out, but the clojure language is making me hesitant.

Spinnaker

What is the tool for exactly (CI? CD? both? ...?) => CD. It exposes endpoints in its pipelines for other CI tools to make use of.

Drone

What is the tool for exactly (CI? CD? both? ...?) => CD, kind of CI.. -> Build steps are commands (aliases) that translate to shell scripts
How hard was the setup?
How clean is the interface? It is clean and modern. But does not give an easy pipeline overview
How flexible is the tool?
How does it visualise build pipelines (if present)?
How much of the configuration can be versioned as code?

GoCD
 Configuration as code is not native, but a lot of plugins exist.
 e.g. json and yaml are very good options here: https://docs.gocd.org/current/advanced_usage/pipelines_as_code.html
